Use this loss function when there are two or more label classes. We expect labels to be provided as integers. If you want to provide labels using `one-hot` representation, please use `CategoricalCrossentropy` loss. There should be `# classes` floating point values per feature for `y_pred` and a single floating point value per feature for `y_true`.

In the snippet below, there is a single floating point value per example for `y_true` and `# classes` floating pointing values per example for `y_pred`. The shape of `y_true` is `[batch_size]` and the shape of `y_pred` is `[batch_size, num_classes]`.
