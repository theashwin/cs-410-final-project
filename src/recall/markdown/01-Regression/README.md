# Regression

## Introduction

The idea of looking at a lot of data samples and trying to predict the dependent variable in a continuous numeric domain is called regression in statistical terms. 

### Assumptions

In order to perform regression on any dataset, it must satisfy the following assumptions:

1. **Normality**: The erros are assumed to be normally distributed 
2. **Independent**: The errors must be independent of each other
3. **Mean and Variance**: They must have zero mean and constant variance (this property of having a **constant variance** is also called **homoscedasticity**

These assumptions are usually verified using Q-Q Plots, S-W test etc.

This chapter offers introduction to various kind of regressions and their use cases.
