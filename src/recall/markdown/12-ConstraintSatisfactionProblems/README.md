# Constraint Satisfaction Problems

The problems of this category usually require the states and goal test to conform to a standard, structured and very simple representation. 

## Definitions

* A CSP is defined by 
	* a set of variables ![x1_xn](http://mathurl.com/yabc3fxk.png)  
	* a set of contraints given by ![c1_cn](http://mathurl.com/ycr6djl5.png). In this setup there can be three categories of constraints:
		* asd
	* each variable ![xi](http://mathurl.com/lo88zjm.png) has a non empty domain ![di](http://mathurl.com/yd47wdhh.png) of possible values. 
* A **state** of the problem is defined by **assignment** of values to some or all of the variables {![](http://mathurl.com/y9bjh8dq.png), ![](http://mathurl.com/y83hv9nc.png), ...}.
* An assignment that does not violate any constraints is called a **consistent** or **legal** assignment. 
* A **complete** assignment is the one, in which all variables of a CSP are mentioned.
* A **complete** and **consistent** assignment is called a solution for any given CSP. 

> **Note:** Although the above process is in reference to assignment problems, some CSVs could also require solutions to maximize an objective function. The underlying principles would still remain the same

## Structure

1. The simplest kind of CSPs are the ones with discrete and finite domains. Map coloring problems and 8-Queens problems are the popular ones of this kind. In case of a problem with domain size **d** and number of variables **n**, the total number of possible and complete assignments is ![](http://mathurl.com/y98mou73.png).

	> This goes on to show that in the worst case scenario, we will not be able to solve finite-domain CSPs in less than exponential time. 

2. There can be problems where the domain for a variable. 

## Solving Mechanism 

It is interesting to see that the a CSP can be given an **incremental formulation** as a standard search problem using the following intuitive procedure:

1. **Initial State**: the empty assignment {}, in which all variables are unassigned
2. **Successor Function**: A value can be assigned to any variable provided that it does not conflict with any previously assigned variables
3. **Goal Test**: The current assignment is complete
4. **Path Cost**: a constant cost (eg. 1) for every step

Every solution must be a complete assignment, therefore appears appears at depth **n** if there are **n** variables. Due to this property **depth first search** algorithms are really popular for CSPs. 

It is also noteworthy that the path taken for reaching a particular solution is irrelevant to the final outcome. Therefore another way to tackle this problem could be to make sure that **every state** is a **complete assignment** which might or might not satisfy the constraints and then use local search methods to find solutions.
