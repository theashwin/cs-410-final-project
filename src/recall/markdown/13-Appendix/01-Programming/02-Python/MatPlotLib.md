# MatPlotLib

This is the visualization library available for plotting graphs in python. It can be imported in any python script as ` import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`. This allows us to use the shorthand notation `plt` rather than having to use the complete name for the plot function.

## Plots

### Line based plot

```python
# For graphs with lines
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.show()
```

### Scatter Plots

```python
# For scatter plots
plt.scatter(x, y)
plt.show()
```

### Histograms

```python
plt.hist(x)
plt.show()
```

### Box Plots

In the example mentioned below, we pass the columns to be plotted, into the `column` argument and the column that we want to compare boxplots across, into the `by` argument.

```python
df.boxplot(column = 'column_name', by = "continent")
```

The lines that extend from a boxplot are called **whiskers**. They represent the maximums and minimums of our data, excluding the outliers. 

#### Customizations

1. **Bins**: The number of default `bins` for a histogram is 10, and it can be altered by passing a different value `plt.hist(x, bins =3)`
2. **Range**: Setting the minimum and maximum value for a histogram is done by using the `range` argument and passing it a tuple `plt.hist(x, range = (0, 10))` 
3. **Normalization**: The data can be normalized before the histogram is plotted using `normed` argument as `plt.hist(x, normed = True)`.
4. **CDF**: A Cumulative Distribution Function can be calculated before plotting by using the Boolean argument `cumulative` in addition to `normed` while plotting `plt.hist(x, cumulative = True, normed = True)`.

### Plotting a DataFrame

A pandas DataFrame can be plotted using the `plt.plot(pd_df)` function. This call would plot all the numeric values in the dataframe across the index. 

### Customizations

1. **Labels**:The customizations for a plot `plt.plot(x,y)` for X and Y **labels** can be done with `plt.xlabel('X')` and `plt.ylabel('Y')`. 
2. **Title**: A title can be added with `plt.title('Plot Title')`.
3. **Altering Axis**: The axis' can be changed by passing an one dimensional array to the `yticks` function as in `plt.yticks([0,2,4,6])`. This would force the Y axis to have these numbers of the intervals. Optionally, a second list of the same length can also be passed to `yticks` for custom labels, while still using the first row as the original axis numbers. It can be done as  `plt.yticks([0,2,4,6],["Zero", "Two", "Four", "Six"])`.
4. **Adding Text**: Text can be added to any point in the plot using `plt.text(x, y, "Text")` syntax.
5. **Logarithms**: If the values are interfering with each other due to dominant behavior of a particular feature, then we can use `plt.yscale('log')` to neutralize the effect of that feature before showing the plot. 
6. **Colors**: Colors can be added for features while plotting them using `pd_df["column_1"].plot(color = "r")`.

## Statistical Significance

### Types of Plots

1. **Bar Plots**: It's a good idea to use bar plots for discrete data counts
2. **Histograms**: Histograms are good for frequency analysis on continuous data columns
3. **Box Plots**: It's a good idea to use box plots to visualize all basic summary statistics for a given column. 
4. **Scatter Plots**: They're used to observe visually, the relationships between two or more numeric columns.

## Exporting plots

We can easily export plots using `plt.savefig('filename.jpg')` before calling `show()` and save the plots.
